 site repository (please don't judge me for the way i live)

 refer to the live version of the site for the things that are actually in use, otherwise don't worry if i have stray code referencing defunct things (old file names, i was using a styleswitcher and then stopped so some pages may have remnants of that, etc.)

 opengraph info is also inconsistent across the site because i was too frustrated to update it individually, refer to the landing page for that if you need to
