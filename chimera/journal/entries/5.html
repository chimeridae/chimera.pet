<p>it's been a while! way longer than i remembered, actually. sorry. it's been a very stressful month. despite the fact i put my 2 weeks in at work at the very beginning of the month, my workplace continued to mistreat me for even longer than that. i was about to explode from it all, lol. but i didn't really want to type up a long journal entry this time. a lot of things have happened since i last talked here, too many for me to recount. all that matters is i'm at least at a point where i don't feel like i'm about to die.</p>

<p>i wanted to share some of the drawings my friends and i have done this month since i lost steam. i used to draw all the time, but for the past few years it became really painful for me. i've been glad to pick it back up a little with friends. i'll maybe catch up a bit for real some more later, but right now i've just got these to share. enjoy!</p>

<p>in this one i drew impmon and vulpix, the yellow sketchy yuuichi, and the personal image in the bottom right. our friend max drew the omega flowey, and the rest are coda's drawings.</p>
