                <p>i used to host a journal here, but i've since subscribed to social death. with less dramatic phrasing: i no longer feel comfortable with allowing anyone to peer into my innermost thoughts, and no longer have a desire to be public-facing. sorry.</p>

                <p>this change in my ideology conflicts with the direction this website has taken, and more specifically, with the approach taken by most other parts that run this site. in the past, i'd always wanted my "own" spaces; now that i no longer want to be personally seen, this makes adapting to this approach troublesome. please be patient while things are ironed out.</p>
