<h1><img src="kaiju.gif"> Pokewalker... accessories?</h1>

<p>did you know that the pokewalker actually had a myriad of different cases released for it? these offered not only some much needed protection and additional portability for your precious pokemon, but also offered a bit of customizability as well! unfortunately though, almost none of these cases that i've been able to find have been released outside of japan. although, there is one exception...</p>

<p>none of these images were taken by me - each one will have a source you can visit by clicking it.</p>

<p>these 2 pokewalker cases are probably the most wellknown, as they're the ones that show up first when you look into the topic on english collection sites. they feature similar designs on the sides and a small icon of the pokemon at the top of each case. i like that they went with the red and blue color schemes for these as opposed to just gold and silver.</p>

<p>the most notable part of this set is probably the lanyard cord that attaches the case to your belt. this is really useful if you end up losing the belt clip that came with the pokewalker initially, and for keeping your pokewalker out of the wash... on top of this, they also included a screen protector. they really went above and beyond!</p>

<p>you may be able to guess that this case is my favorite out of all of the ones i've been able to find...  the green, yellow and neon blue are such a beautiful combo, and i'm glad that all the designs on this case series are distinctive. celebi is personally important to me and so if i were to get any case out of these, this would be my #1 want.</p>

<p>this pikachu released at the same time as the celebi case. it seems like a weird pairing to me, personally i wish there was a suicune one instead...</p>

<p>these next sets of cases were released by a different company, it seems - and were pokemon center exclusive. despite the fact they lack the cords and LCD screen protector that the previous set came with, i actually prefer the designs of these ones when it comes to the lugia and ho oh cases. i'm a sucker for the simple black and white, and i like the art on the back.</p>

<p>everyone's favorite pikachu to end these off. i like this one less than the lugia and ho-oh ones. even though this set of cases came with less than the others, i like the packaging on all of the ones by this company a bit more overall.<p>

<h1><img src="slow.gif"> The 1 exception</h1>

<p>if you were lucky enough to have lived in north america and ordered HG/SS online from walmart whenever it released, you could have gotten the lucky <strong>bonus box</strong> that contained not only the standard pre-release figures for the game, but also exclusive pokewalker cases that came with a wrist strap. they were originally online exclusives, but may have shown up in local stores not long after release.</p>

<p>the wrist strap on these is fabric, and instead of the pokemon icons at the top, it has the english logo for each respective game. the back of each case also has a silver or gold silhouette of the respective box legendary. man, even though the design is so simple compared to the others - what an amazing item to own... i consider myself lucky to have the prerelease lugia figure that came with my game at all, let alone something as rare as this!</p>

<p>these are all of the silicone cases i were able to find in my limited search that were specifically designed for the pokewalker. however, if you know of any others that were released in japan or otherwise, please let me know!</p>
